This repository contains all my C programming exercises and their solutions from the first semester (S1).
It serves as an organized collection of my work, covering essential concepts such as variables, data types,
control structures (loops and conditionals), functions, and pointers. The goal is to track my progress,
keep my code structured, and provide clear, compilable examples for anyone learning the fundamentals of C.
